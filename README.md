DMX Control Tool
================

Quick utility for controlling a relay unit over DMX, via an FTDI USB-to-RS485 adaptor.

Give the numbers of channels to turn on as arguments; they will be set to 200 and everything else will be set to 0.

Basically an excuse for me to finally try and use Rust for something practical, after already doing the same job in Python (slow) and C (ugly).
